# Vue Service Bay

## Overview

Meet Vue Service Bayâ€”your go-to micro-utility for effortless, bulk modifications in Vue.js components. Say goodbye to tedious, manual refactoring and accelerate your development pipeline with this lightweight yet powerful tool.

## Motivation

Refactoring generally follows one of two approaches: incremental or wholesale. The approach you choose depends on your project. For instance, if you need to apply a new design system across your entire codebase all at once, this tool is invaluable. Machines can execute simple tasks far faster and more accurately than humans. Automating your refactoring tasks with this library will significantly improve efficiency and accuracy. This repository provides a tool for applying such refactoring to Vue.js components.

## How the Migration Works

The following flowchart simplifies the interaction between this repository and your workflow:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Vue Service Bay
    v1[Read Vue file]-->v2[Split by section]
    v2[Split by section]-->v3[Parse to AST]
    v4[AST to Vue file]
    end
    subgraph User land's code
    v3-->u1[Manipulate AST]
    u1-->v4
    end
```

Even if you're new to manipulating AST (Abstract Syntax Trees), this repository provides plenty of examples to get you started.

## Playground

To try out this tool, clone the repository:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:flyle-io/vue-service-bay.git
cd vue-service-bay
npm install
cd packages/examples
node migration/index.js
# Check the migration results however you like!
git difftool
```

## How to Use

### Installation

Install Vue Service Bay as a dev dependency:

```sh
npm i -D vue-service-bay
```

The `-D` flag installs the package as a development dependency.

### Create a Migration Runner File

First, you'll need to create a migration runner script. For more details, please refer to the [index.js](./packages/examples/migration/index.js) in our examples.

### Implement the Runner Script

Next, you'll need to implement specific migration logic. See our examples for more details:

- [Regexp example](./packages/examples/migration/001_RegexpExamples.js)
- [Ast example](./packages/examples/migration/002_AstManipulateExamples.js)
- [MagicString example](./packages/examples/migration/003_MagicStringExamples.js)

### Run the Migration Runner

Execute your migration runner script:

```sh
node index.js
```

## Supported Languages

Vue Service Bay can be used with any language for migrations that do not require AST manipulation. However, if you're using AST, the following languages are currently supported. If you'd like to add support for other languages, feel free to submit a PR.
